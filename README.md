# Chat App
This is a Chat room web application with retro style implemented using websocket via socket.io and React fronend

My goal is to create a chat room service with no login requirement.
User may just enter the chat room after entering the name.
After first login, Name and userId are stored within local stored.

## Features
- User can create a room with any name and have other users join to chat in the same room
- App will show which users are currently in the same chat room as the User.
- Room with no user will be terminated automatically
- Text Editor allows User to format text
